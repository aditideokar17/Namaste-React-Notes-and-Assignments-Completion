● What is Enzyme?
Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React that helps test the output of React components

● Enzyme vs React Testing Library
Enzyme :
Allows access to a component's internal workings, including state and props, and can be used to mock children. Enzyme is best for testing the implementation of a component. 

React Testing Library :
Focuses on testing how a user would interact with a component, rather than the component's implementation details. React Testing Library is best for testing the behavior of a component.
